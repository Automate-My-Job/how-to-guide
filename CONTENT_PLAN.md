The current project is a documentation site for a Job Automation platform called Automate-My-Job.com.


The aim of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide to the platform for both new and existing users.

Currently the site is built with Gitbook and hosted on Github, there are some basic examples of markdown files in basics/ and getting-started/

I want to provide the following content:

- Home page (Landing page for Documentation)
- Installation Guide
- Core Concepts
- How to create a new project
- How to add a project to the verified projects list


Use inspiration from the current markdown files to create icons, images, any other assets that would make things look good.
